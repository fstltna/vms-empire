# vms-empire 1.16bbs
Version of VMS Empire for use as a BBS door

***

Set it up in scfg like this:

![VMS-Empire as BBS door](https://synchronetbbs.org/VMS-Empire_SBBS_Config.png) 

When logging in it will now display the username it will be using, and if the optional "BBS Mode" is enabled it will be displayed as well. If testing I suggest making sure it has "Pause After Execution" is enabled so you can see more details.
